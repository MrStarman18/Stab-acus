# Stab-acus
/*Developer: Justin T. Alexander
Date: June 20, 2022
Project: Stab-acus!
Personal project developed from May-June 2022. A 2-player head-to-head video game, and my first original game! */

I'm including each version of Stab-acus from every stage of the development period, so I apologize for the confusing name structure. 
stabacusv1.out is the current build that should be able to run independently; it includes all of the needed files. For those curious, I'll describe the other files still:

The build is comprised of:
-stabacus.cpp (runs the game), 
-hosttext.h (quirky text to be displayed at key moments), 
-and stabacus-game.cpp & stabacus-game.h (define functions needed to play the game, such as Stabbing and Moving). 

In theory, stabacusv1.out would run the game by itself. However, I'm trying to explore options to allow the game to run without needing an IDE/IDLE.
Currently experimenting with creating a stab-acus.exe file, which I'll share once progress has been made!
